Maintainer: Carson Stacy <clstacy@uark.edu>
Description: This package calculates the Weighted Spectral Difference between molar elipticity values from Circular Dichroism experiments across a gradient of pH. 
    It is able to analyze across pH and for more than one protein.
    The Weighted Spectral Difference is calculated according to the formula of Dinh et al., 2014 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2014.07.011)
